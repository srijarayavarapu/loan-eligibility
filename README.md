Built a model to predict if a person is eligible for a loan based on parameters like income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

Used data preprocessing, feature selection, and supervised algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to select the best model.

Improved model accuracy by handling missing values and scaling features for better prediction.
